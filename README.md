# Project-Analysis-II

This repository contains project analysis documentation that was produced as my team's coursework project
within **CTU FEE B6B36SMP â€“ Analysis and Modeling of Software Requirements** university course.  
The majority of content was created following the UML notation, using Enterprise Architect modelling tool.

## Project description

Bouldering gym network with several branches across Prague plans to introduce a significantly improved, unified
information system, that will centralize and expand the range of the available cutomer services and link all its
branches together into a single online fuctional unit.
The system will offer comprehensive information about individual gyms, routes and events, the option
of online reservations, membership management, reviews, notifications and other features that will benefit
both for visitors and operators.

This documentation is intended as a product of work of project analysts of the IT company, which is committed to the 
platform implementation and represents a more or less complete cycle of IT project analysis from
setting business goals and modelling business requirements to detailed design of specific parts
of user interface and system architecture, mainly in the form of UML diagrams.

## Important notes

1. Unlike the [previous](https://github.com/IvanShestachenko/Project-Analysis-I) project of the same kind, my role in the team here was a regular individual contributor working on the assigned tasks. Because of this fact, regardless of my personal contribution, I do not hold full responsibility for 100% of the contents of this documentation. However, I can claim to have the complete understanding and the ability to produce
similar analysis documentations on different business cases.
2. It is mentioned in the description, that this documentation attempts to reflect a ***complete*** project analysis for this particular business case. Yet it is clear, that the analysis here, especially when being put into real commercial environment's conditions, is missing lots of things. For starters, it would have to include much more requirements of all the levels and categories; there would be a need to define certain quality restrictions; more use cases would require detailed specifications, etc. The reason is that the main goal of this university course was to introduce us to the process as a whole, and to the syntax and semantics of the particular UML diagrams. The assignments were typically phrased in a way that would require us to produce N relevant diagrams of a certain kind per team or per person in a team.
